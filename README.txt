Hello This Is a simple Game Run In cmd coded in C++
Games are written as headerfiles and can be added into the main function

add a game if you want.
This is likely one of the most uninspired open source projects ever so yeah

There are currently issues with functions being incompatible due to being declared globally.
I am working to fix this!!
